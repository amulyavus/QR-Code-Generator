# QR-Code-Generator

A QR code generator project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves creating a web application where users can input text or URLs and generate corresponding QR codes. The interface is built with HTML and styled with CSS, providing a user-friendly layout. JavaScript handles the functionality, capturing user input and using a QR code library to generate the QR code image. The generated QR code can be displayed on the page and optionally downloaded by the user. This project demonstrates interactive web development and the practical use of external libraries.
